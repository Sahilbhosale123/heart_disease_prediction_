Abstract


Heart disease is considered as one of the fatal diseases across the globe. From the past few years, millions of cases are increasing and many people died due to heart related issues. As heart is important organ in the human body, any issue related to it highly affects human health. The factors that cause heart disease are age, overweight, stress, unhealthy diet and smoking. The main goal of this topic is to create a model to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms, which will aid doctors in detecting the disease early on with less medical tests and providing appropriate care, potentially saving many lives. Machine learning is playing an essential role in the medical side. Using this machine learning method, we will easily able to predict the factors such as sensitivity, accuracy and so on, which gives the best classification model for prediction of occurrence of heart disease.
