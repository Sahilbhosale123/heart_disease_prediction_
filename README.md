Abstract


Heart disease is considered as one of the fatal diseases across the globe. From the past few years, millions of cases are increasing and many people died due to heart related issues. As heart is important organ in the human body, any issue related to it highly affects human health. The factors that cause heart disease are age, overweight, stress, unhealthy diet and smoking. The main goal of this topic is to create a model to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms, which will aid doctors in detecting the disease early on with less medical tests and providing appropriate care, potentially saving many lives. Machine learning is playing an essential role in the medical side. Using this machine learning method, we will easily able to predict the factors such as sensitivity, accuracy and so on, which gives the best classification model for prediction of occurrence of heart disease.


 

Conclusion : 

We have successfully compared the accuracy of various machine learning algorithms . Random forest algorithm is the best algorithm which gives a great accuracy standard for producing the best estimation result .  


Future Scope
The computational time was also reduced which is helpful when deploying a model. It was also found out that the dataset should be normalized; otherwise, the training model gets overfitted sometimes and the accuracy achieved is not sufficient when a model is evaluated for real-world data problems which can vary drastically to the dataset on which the model was trained. The difficulty which came here is that the sample size of the dataset is not large. If a large dataset is present, the results can increase very much in deep learning and ML as well. The algorithm applied by us in ANN architecture increased the accuracy which we compared with the different researchers. The dataset size can be increased and then deep learning with various other optimizations can be used and more promising results can be achieved. Machine learning and various other optimization techniques can also be used so that the evaluation results can again be increased. More different ways of normalizing the data can be used and the results can be compared. And more ways could be found where we could integrate heart-disease-trained ML and DL models with certain multimedia for the ease of patients and doctors.
